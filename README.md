## About

_**Petal**_ is a small language on [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/) with similar syntax to [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org).

The primal motivation of this project is reducing the size of source code for our _telecoding_ live performance of [space-moere](http://space-moere.org/) at [SIAF2017](http://siaf.jp/en/).

## Requirements

Sonic Pi v2.11 or v2.10

## Installation

Download zip file from [Release Page](https://github.com/siaflab/petal/releases/) and extract it.

## Usage

Open an empty Sonic Pi buffer, type in the following code and hit `Run`.

```ruby
load "~/petal/petal.rb"   # the path you extract the file

d1 'bd'
```
